# gisdk_tools

These are generic "brick and blocks" for travel demand models written in GISDK
for TransCAD. This repository is intended to be imported as a submodule to other
model repos. It is also intended to make travel models more sophisticated and
less complicated.

The [wiki](https://github.com/pbsag/gisdk_tools/wiki) is the place for guidance
